## Inspiration

This is a game I played a lot with friends and family on paper, so I decided that a website would be better for this game.

## Challenges

Creating the functionality of the game, especially arounding checking if fields are filled out correctly or not.

## The Website

This is a website where you can play a word guessing game where you have a chosen word. When someone guesses a word, you challenge the word and it tells you what letters are in common.
