## Inspiration

This is a game I played a lot with friends and family on paper, so I decided that a website would be better for this game due to many instances of human error when playing with paper and pencil.

## Challenges

Creating the functionality of the game, especially around checking if fields are filled out correctly or not.

## Lessons Learned

I learned about comparing values and making sure all types of scenarios presented are met with an answer.

## The Website

This is a website where you can play a word guessing game. Decide on the number of letters for the word to be guessed. The word creator thinks of a word with that many letters and enters it into the "Chosen Word" box. When the player or team makes a guess, the word creator inputs the guessed word into the "Word Challenge" box and clicks the "Challenge" button. The "Alphabet Count" box then shows how many letters the two words have in common, and the "Alphabets Found" box reveals which letters are shared. The goal for the player or team is to discover the word the creator initially thought of. Once a round is finished, hit the "Reset" button to start a new game.
